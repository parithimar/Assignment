1) To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
   An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
   
   examples of some of the escape characters are
    \' Single Quote
    \\ Backslash
    \n New Line
    \r Carriage Return
    \t Tab
    \b Backspace
    \f Form Feed
    \ooo Octal value
    \xhh Hex value
    
2) n stands for new line and t stands for Tab

3) In Python strings, the backslash “ ” is a special character, also called the “escape” character. It is used in representing certain            whitespace characters: “\t” is a tab, “\n” is a new line, and “\r” is a carriage return. Finally, “ ” can be used to escape itself: “\” is    the literal backslash character.

4) we can use single quote within double quote without escape character

5) In order to print without newline in Python, you need to add an extra argument "end " to your print function that will tell the program that you don’t want your next string to be on a new line.

 example:

print("Hello there!", end = '')
print("It is a great day.")


6)'e'
  'Hello'
  'Hello'
  'lo, world!'
  
7) HELLO
   True
   hello
