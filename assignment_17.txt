1. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me. Then, write the conditional tests (if, else, and elif) to print the string 'too low' if guess_me is less than 7, 'too high' if greater than 7, and 'just right' if equal to 7.

guess_me = 7
guess = int(input("Enetr your guess: "))
if guess < guess_me:
  print('too low')
elif guess > guess_me:
  print('too high')
else:
  print('equal')
Enetr your guess: 7
equal

2. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me and the value 1 to the variable start. Write a while loop that compares start with guess_me. Print too low if start is less than guess me. If start equals guess_me, print 'found it!' and exit the loop. If start is greater than guess_me, print 'oops' and exit the loop. Increment start at the end of the loop.

guess_me = 7
start = 1
while True:
  if start > guess_me:
    print('oops')
  elif start < guess_me:
    print('too low')
  else:
    print('found it!')
    break
  start = start + 1
too low
too low
too low
too low
too low
too low
found it!

3. Print the following values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0] using a for loop.

l = [3, 2, 1, 0]
for i in l:
  print(i)
3
2
1
0

4. Use a list comprehension to make a list of the even numbers in range(10)

a = [i for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0]
print(a)
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

5. Use a dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary squares. Use range(10) to return the keys, and use the square of each key as its value.

b = {i:i**2 for i in range(10)}
print(b)
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}

6. Construct the set odd from the odd numbers in the range using a set comprehension (10).

c = {i for i in range(10) if i%2 != 0}
print(c)
{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}

7. Use a generator comprehension to return the string 'Got ' and a number for the numbers in range(10). Iterate through this by using a for loop.

n = 10
generator = ('Got ' + str(i) for i in range(n))
for item in generator:
    print(item)
Got 0
Got 1
Got 2
Got 3
Got 4
Got 5
Got 6
Got 7
Got 8
Got 9

8. Define a function called good that returns the list ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione'].

def good():
  return ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']
good()

9. Define a generator function called get_odds that returns the odd numbers from range(10). Use a for loop to find and print the third value returned

def get_odds():
  for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 != 0:
      yield i
count = 0
for i in get_odds():
  if count == 2:
    print(i)
    break
  count += 1
5

10. Define an exception called OopsException. Raise this exception to see what happens. Then write the code to catch this exception and print 'Caught an oops'.

class OopsException(Exception):
  pass

def demo_exception(a):
  if a % 2 == 0:
    raise OopsException(a)

try:
  demo_exception(2)
except OopsException as e:
  print('Caught an oops')
Caught an oops

11. Use zip() to make a dictionary called movies that pairs these lists: titles = ['Creature of Habit', 'Crewel Fate'] and plots = ['A nun turns into a monster', 'A haunted yarn shop'].

titles = ['Creature of Habit', 'Crewel Fate']
plots = ['A nun turns into a monster', 'A haunted yarn shop']
movies ={v:k for v,k in zip(titles,plots)}
print(movies)
{'Creature of Habit': 'A nun turns into a monster', 'Crewel Fate': 'A haunted yarn shop'}
