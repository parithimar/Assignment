1) True and False are the two boolean values we write them using True , False


2) and,or, not are the three boolean operators


3) here T represents True and F represents False

    and operator truth table
    
    T and T=T
    T and F=F
    F and T=F
    F and F=F
    
    or operator truth table
    
    T or T = T
    T or F = T
    F or T = T
    F or F = F
    
    not operator truth table
    
    not T = F
    not F = T
    
    
4) (5>4) and (3==5) evaluates to false
   not(5>4) evaluates to false
   (5>4) or (3==5) evaluates to true
   not((5>4) or (3==5)) evaluates to false
   (True and True) and (True==False) evaluates to false
   (not False) or (not True) evaluates to true
   
   
5) < , <= , > , >= , ==, != are the six comparison operators
   
   
6) == is the equal to operator and = is the assignment operator.
   if you want to check whether two operands are equal we use == operator.suppose variables a=4 and b=5 then  if we want to
    check their equality then we use a==b.
    
    and in the above example we assigned a as 4 and b as 5 here we use assignmet operator a = 4 .
    
    
7) first part

    spam=0
       if spam>10:
            print('eggs')
            
        the second part
        
        if spam>5:
            print("bacon")
            
        third part
        
        else:
            print('ham')
            print('spam')
            print('spam')
            
            
8)

spam = int(input('enter an integer'))

if spam==1:
    print('hello')
elif spam==2:
    print('howdy')
else:
    print('greetings')
    
    
    
    
9)ctrl+c

10)break statement exits a loop where as continue statement exits a current iteration and goes to the next iteration.

11)no difference all three gives the same output.

12)
   using for loop
   
  for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
   
using while loop

i=1
while i <11:
    print(i)
    i+=1
    
13)spam.bacon()
